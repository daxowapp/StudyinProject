==================================================

# Admin Password Reset Guide

## 🔐 How to Reset Admin Password

There are **4 methods** to reset the admin password. Choose the one that works best for you:

---

## Method 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Easiest) ⭐

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Users**
4. Find the admin user (usually `admin@studyatchina.com`)
5. Click the **three dots (...)** menu next to the user
6. Select **"Send password reset email"**
7. Check the admin email inbox
8. Click the reset link and set a new password

**Pros:** Simple, secure, no coding required
**Cons:** Requires email access

---

## Method 2: Using Node.js Script (Recommended) ⭐

I've created a script for you at `/scripts/reset-admin-password.js`

### Steps:

1. **Ensure you have the Service Role Key:**

   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```

   Get this from: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → service_role key

2. **Install dependencies (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js dotenv
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   node scripts/reset-admin-password.js
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Enter admin email (or press Enter for default)
   - Enter new password (min 6 characters)
   - Confirm password

5. **Save the credentials shown!**

**Pros:** Quick, automated, can create new admin if needed
**Cons:** Requires Service Role Key

---

## Method 3: Using Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **SQL Editor**
2. Run this query to find the admin user:

   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, raw_user_meta_data
   FROM auth.users
   WHERE email = 'admin@studyatchina.com';
   ```

3. Copy the user ID

4. Use Supabase Auth API to reset password:
   - You cannot directly update passwords via SQL for security
   - Use Method 1 or Method 2 instead

**Note:** SQL method is limited due to security restrictions

---

## Method 4: Create New Admin User

If you can't access the existing admin account, create a new one:

### Via Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Click **"Add user"**
3. Enter email: `newadmin@studyatchina.com`
4. Enter password
5. Check **"Auto Confirm User"**
6. Click **"Create user"**

7. Then update user metadata via SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   UPDATE auth.users
   SET
       raw_user_meta_data = jsonb_set(
           COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb),
           '{role}',
           '"admin"'
       )
   WHERE email = 'newadmin@studyatchina.com';
   ```

### Via Node.js Script:

Run the script and choose to create a new admin when prompted:

```bash
node scripts/reset-admin-password.js
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Admin Access

After resetting the password, verify it works:

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
2. Enter admin email and new password
3. You should be redirected to admin dashboard

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "User not found"

- Check the email is correct
- Verify user exists in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- Create a new admin user using Method 4

### "Invalid credentials"

- Password was not updated correctly
- Try Method 1 (password reset email)
- Ensure email is confirmed (check `email_confirmed_at` in database)

### "Missing Service Role Key"

- Get it from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
- Add to `.env.local` as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Important:** This is different from the `anon` key!

### "Password too weak"

- Supabase requires minimum 6 characters
- Use a strong password with letters, numbers, and symbols

---

## 📋 Default Admin Credentials

If you just set up the project, the default admin might be:

**Email:** `admin@studyatchina.com`
**Password:** (whatever you set during initial setup)

If you don't remember, use one of the reset methods above.

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Use a strong password:**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Don't reuse passwords

2. **Keep Service Role Key secure:**
   - Never commit to Git
   - Only in `.env.local` (which is gitignored)
   - Has full database access!

3. **Enable 2FA (if available):**
   - Check Supabase settings for 2FA options

4. **Regular password rotation:**
   - Change admin password every 90 days
   - Use a password manager

---

## 🎯 Quick Reset (TL;DR)

**Fastest method:**

```bash
# 1. Add Service Role Key to .env.local
# 2. Run script
node scripts/reset-admin-password.js

# 3. Follow prompts
# 4. Done! ✅
```

**Alternative (no coding):**

1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Find admin → Send password reset email
3. Check email → Reset password
4. Done! ✅

---

## 📞 Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure Supabase project is active
4. Check email spam folder for reset emails

# Admission Requirements Integration

## Overview

Successfully integrated the admission requirements system from the backend database into the program detail pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Program Page Updates (`/programs/[slug]/page.tsx`)

- **Fetches requirements from database** using `v_university_admission_requirements` view
- Filters requirements by:
  - University ID
  - Program level (Bachelor, Master, PhD, or "all")
- Groups requirements by category (academic, language, document, financial, other)
- Passes structured data to ProgramRequirements component

### 2. ProgramRequirements Component Updates

- **Enhanced to handle 5 categories:**
  - ✅ Academic Requirements
  - ✅ Language Requirements
  - ✅ Document Requirements
  - ✅ Financial Requirements (NEW)
  - ✅ Additional Information/Other (NEW)

- **Flexible data handling:**
  - Supports both string format (legacy)
  - Supports object format with `name`, `required`, and `note` fields

- **Visual improvements:**
  - Financial requirements with dollar icon
  - Additional info with info icon
  - Conditional rendering (only shows sections with data)
  - Better formatting for notes and descriptions

## Database Structure

### Tables Used:

1. **`admission_requirements_catalog`** - Master list of all requirements
2. **`university_admission_requirements`** - Junction table linking universities to requirements
3. **`v_university_admission_requirements`** - View for easy querying

### Requirement Categories:

- `academic` - Diplomas, GPA, transcripts
- `language` - IELTS, TOEFL, HSK scores
- `document` - Passport, photos, certificates
- `financial` - Bank statements, guarantees
- `other` - Age limits, health, interviews

### Requirement Types:

- `bachelor` - For undergraduate programs
- `master` - For graduate programs
- `phd` - For doctoral programs
- `all` - Applies to all levels

## How It Works

1. **User visits program page** → `/programs/computer-science-tsinghua-university`

2. **System fetches:**
   - Program details from `v_university_programs_full`
   - Admission requirements from `v_university_admission_requirements`

3. **Requirements are filtered by:**
   - University ID (e.g., Tsinghua University)
   - Program level (e.g., Bachelor + "all")

4. **Requirements are grouped by category** and displayed in organized sections

5. **Each requirement shows:**
   - Title (e.g., "IELTS 6.0")
   - Description (e.g., "IELTS score of 6.0 or above...")
   - Required/Optional status
   - Custom notes (if university added specific info)

## Benefits

✅ **Dynamic** - Requirements come from database, not hardcoded
✅ **Flexible** - Universities can customize requirements
✅ **Organized** - Clear categorization by type
✅ **Detailed** - Shows descriptions and notes
✅ **Accurate** - Level-specific requirements (Bachelor vs Master)
✅ **Maintainable** - Easy to update via admin panel

## Next Steps

To populate requirements for your universities:

1. **Run the migration** (if not already done):

   ```sql
   -- Execute DATABASE_MIGRATION_ADMISSION_REQUIREMENTS.sql
   ```

2. **Link requirements to universities** via admin panel or SQL:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO university_admission_requirements (university_id, requirement_id, is_required, display_order)
   SELECT
       (SELECT id FROM universities WHERE slug = 'your-university-slug'),
       id,
       true,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY category, title)
   FROM admission_requirements_catalog
   WHERE requirement_type IN ('bachelor', 'all')
   AND is_common = true;
   ```

3. **Customize as needed:**
   - Add custom notes for specific requirements
   - Mark some as optional
   - Adjust display order
   - Add university-specific requirements to the catalog

## Example Output

When viewing a Bachelor program at Tsinghua University, students will see:

### Entry Requirements

==================================================
FILE: ./docs/AUTOMATIC_UNIVERSITY_DETECTION.md
==================================================

# Automatic University Detection in Articles

## 🎯 Feature Overview

The system now **automatically detects** when universities are mentioned in articles and displays them at the bottom of the article page!

## ✨ How It Works

### Automatic Detection:

1. **Scans Article Content:** The system reads both the article title and content
2. **Matches University Names:** Looks for exact matches of university names (both English and local names)
3. **Smart Matching:** Uses word boundaries to avoid partial matches
4. **Displays Results:** Shows all mentioned universities in beautiful cards at the bottom

### What Gets Detected:

- ✅ **English names** (e.g., "Tsinghua University")
- ✅ **Local names** (e.g., "清华大学")
- ✅ **Case-insensitive** matching
- ✅ **Whole word** matching (avoids false positives)

## 📝 Example Usage

### In Your Article:

```html
<h2>Top Universities in Beijing</h2>
<p>
  Beijing is home to many prestigious universities. Tsinghua University and
  Peking University are among the best in China...
</p>

<p>
  Another great option is Beijing Normal University, which specializes in
  education programs...
</p>
```

### Result:

The system will automatically detect and display cards for:

- Tsinghua University
- Peking University
- Beijing Normal University

## 🎨 Display Features

Each detected university is shown with:

- **University Logo** (or icon if no logo)
- **University Name** (English)
- **Local Name** (Chinese)
- **Location** (City, Province)
- **"View University" Button** (links to university page)
- **Hover Effects** (border highlight, shadow)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Detection Algorithm:

```typescript
// Searches for university names in article content
// Uses regex with word boundaries for accurate matching
// Example: "Tsinghua University" will match
// But "TsinghuaUniversity" won't match (needs spaces)
```

### Performance:

- ✅ Server-side detection (fast, no client-side processing)
- ✅ Only active universities are checked
- ✅ Cached university data
- ✅ No impact on page load speed

## 📋 Benefits

1. **SEO Boost:** Internal linking to university pages
2. **User Experience:** Easy navigation to mentioned universities
3. **Content Discovery:** Helps users find relevant universities
4. **Automatic:** No manual work required
5. **Smart:** Only shows when universities are actually mentioned

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Perfect For Articles About:

- **University Rankings:** "Top 10 Universities in China"
- **City Guides:** "Best Universities in Shanghai"
- **Program Guides:** "Where to Study Engineering in China"
- **Comparison Articles:** "Tsinghua vs Peking University"
- **Admission Guides:** "How to Apply to Fudan University"

## 💡 Tips for Writers

To ensure universities are detected:

1. **Use Full Names:** Write "Tsinghua University" not just "Tsinghua"
2. **Spell Correctly:** Match the exact name in the database
3. **Include Both Names:** Use both English and Chinese names for better detection
4. **Natural Writing:** Just write naturally - the system handles the rest!

## 🔄 How It Updates

- **Real-time:** Detection happens when the article page loads
- **Automatic:** No manual tagging needed
- **Dynamic:** If you update the article, universities update automatically
- **Smart:** Only shows universities that exist in your database

## 📊 Example Output

When an article mentions "Tsinghua University" and "Peking University":

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Universities Mentioned in This Article            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                     │
│  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐               │
│  │ [Logo]       │  │ [Logo]       │               │
│  │ Tsinghua     │  │ Peking       │               │
│  │ University   │  │ University   │               │
│  │ 清华大学      │  │ 北京大学      │               │

│  │ [View Univ]  │  │ [View Univ]  │               │
│  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

Possible improvements:

1. **Program Detection:** Also detect program names

3. **Highlight Text:** Highlight university names in the article
4. **Related Programs:** Show programs from mentioned universities

==================================================

# Currency Converter System - Usage Guide

## Overview

The currency converter system allows users to view all prices on the website in their preferred currency. It supports 35+ currencies from MENA and CIS regions, with automatic conversion using live exchange rates.

## Features

- ✅ 35+ currencies (MENA + CIS + Major currencies)
- ✅ Live exchange rates (updated hourly)
- ✅ Persistent currency selection (localStorage)
- ✅ Automatic price conversion throughout the site
- ✅ Currency selector in navbar
- ✅ Grouped currency dropdown (Major / MENA / CIS)

## How to Use the Price Component

Replace hardcoded prices with the `<Price>` component:

### Before:

```tsx
<div>¥{program.tuition_fee} CNY</div>
```

### After:

```tsx
import { Price } from "@/components/currency/Price";

<Price amount={program.tuition_fee} currency="CNY" />;
```

## Price Component Props

```tsx
interface PriceProps {
  amount: number; // The price amount
  currency?: string; // Source currency (default: 'CNY')
  className?: string; // Optional CSS classes
  showCurrency?: boolean; // Show currency code (default: true)
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
<Price amount={50000} currency="CNY" />
// Output: ¥ 50,000 CNY (or converted to user's selected currency)
```

### Without Currency Code

```tsx
<Price amount={50000} currency="CNY" showCurrency={false} />
// Output: ¥ 50,000
```

### With Custom Styling

```tsx
<Price
  amount={50000}
  currency="CNY"
  className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary"
/>
```

### Different Source Currencies

```tsx
<Price amount={1000} currency="USD" />
<Price amount={5000} currency="SAR" />
<Price amount={100000} currency="EGP" />
```

## Files to Update

To add currency conversion to existing pages, update these files:

### 1. Program Cards

**File:** `src/components/programs/ProgramCard.tsx`

```tsx
import { Price } from "@/components/currency/Price";

// Replace:
<span>{tuition}</span>

// With:
<Price amount={tuition_fee} currency={currency} />
```

### 2. University Cards

**File:** `src/components/universities/UniversityCard.tsx`

```tsx
// Replace tuition fee display with:
<Price amount={minTuitionFee} currency="CNY" />
```

### 3. Featured Programs

**File:** `src/components/home/FeaturedProgramsSection.tsx`

```tsx
// Replace price displays with:
<Price amount={program.tuition_fee} currency={program.currency} />
```

### 4. Application Forms

**File:** `src/components/applications/ApplyForm.tsx`

```tsx
// Replace payment amounts with:
<Price amount={totalFee} currency="CNY" />
```

### 5. Payment Pages

**File:** `src/app/dashboard/payments/page.tsx`

```tsx
// Replace all payment amounts with Price component
```

## Supported Currencies

### Major Currencies (2)

- CNY - Chinese Yuan
- USD - US Dollar

### MENA Region (22)

- AED - UAE Dirham
- SAR - Saudi Riyal
- EGP - Egyptian Pound
- KWD - Kuwaiti Dinar

### CIS Countries (12)

- RUB - Russian Ruble
- KZT - Kazakhstani Tenge
- UZS - Uzbekistani Som
- AZN - Azerbaijani Manat
- And 8 more...

## Exchange Rate API

The system uses [exchangerate-api.com](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) for live rates:

- Free tier: 1500 requests/month
- Updates: Every hour
- Fallback: Hardcoded rates if API fails

## Advanced Usage

### Using the Currency Hook

```tsx
import { useCurrency } from "@/contexts/CurrencyContext";

function MyComponent() {
  const { currency, setCurrency, exchangeRates } = useCurrency();

  return (
    <div>
      Current currency: {currency}
      <button onClick={() => setCurrency("USD")}>Switch to USD</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using the Convert Price Hook

```tsx
import { useConvertPrice } from "@/contexts/CurrencyContext";

function MyComponent() {
  const convertPrice = useConvertPrice();

  const priceInCNY = 50000;
  const convertedPrice = convertPrice(priceInCNY, "CNY");

  return <div>{convertedPrice}</div>;
}
```

## Testing

1. Navigate to any page with prices
2. Click the currency selector in the navbar (next to language selector)
3. Select a different currency
4. All prices should update automatically
5. Refresh the page - selected currency should persist

## Next Steps

To complete the integration:

1. ✅ Update all program cards to use `<Price>` component
2. ✅ Update university cards
3. ✅ Update featured programs section
4. ✅ Update application forms
5. ✅ Update payment pages
6. ✅ Update admin dashboard (if showing prices)
7. ✅ Test with different currencies
8. ✅ Verify exchange rates are updating

## Troubleshooting

### Prices not converting?

- Check if component is wrapped in `<CurrencyProvider>`
- Verify the Price component is imported correctly
- Check browser console for errors

### Exchange rates not loading?

- Check network tab for API calls
- Fallback rates will be used if API fails
- Rates update every hour

### Currency not persisting?

- Check localStorage in browser DevTools
- Key: `preferred-currency`
- Clear localStorage and try again

SELECT slug, COUNT(*)
FROM universities
GROUP BY slug
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Fix by updating duplicates manually
```

# Deployment Guide for StudyAtChina

This guide covers the steps to deploy the StudyAtChina application to production using Vercel, Supabase, and Stripe.

## Prerequisites

- [Vercel Account](https://vercel.com)
- [Supabase Account](https://supabase.com)
- [Stripe Account](https://stripe.com)
- GitHub Repository with the project code

## 1. Supabase Setup (Production)

1.  **Create a new Project**: Log in to Supabase and create a new project for production.
2.  **Database Schema**:
    - Go to the **SQL Editor**.
    - Copy the content of `supabase/schema.sql` from your local project.
    - Run the SQL query to create tables and policies.
3.  **Seed Data (Optional)**:
    - If you want initial data, run the content of `supabase/seed.sql`.
4.  **Get Credentials**:
    - Go to **Project Settings** -> **API**.
    - Copy the `Project URL` and `anon` public key.
    - Copy the `service_role` secret key (keep this safe!).

## 2. Stripe Setup (Production)

1.  **Activate Account**: Ensure your Stripe account is activated for production payments.
2.  **Get Keys**:
    - Go to **Developers** -> **API keys**.
    - Copy the `Publishable key` and `Secret key`.
3.  **Webhook (Optional)**:
    - If you implemented webhooks, configure the endpoint in Stripe to point to your production URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`).

## 3. Vercel Deployment

1.  **Import Project**:
    - Log in to Vercel.
    - Click **Add New** -> **Project**.
    - Import your GitHub repository.
2.  **Configure Project**:
    - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
    - **Root Directory**: `./` (default)
3.  **Environment Variables**:
    - Add the following variables:
      - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase Project URL
      - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase Anon Key
      - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your Supabase Service Role Key
      - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Your Stripe Secret Key
      - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your Stripe Publishable Key
      - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Your production domain (e.g., `https://studyatchina.com`)
4.  **Deploy**:
    - Click **Deploy**. Vercel will build and deploy your application.

## 4. Post-Deployment Checks

1.  **Auth**: Try signing up and logging in.
2.  **Database**: Verify that data is loading from your production Supabase project.
3.  **Payments**: Test a payment (use a real card for small amount or Stripe test card if in test mode).
4.  **Images**: Ensure all images (Unsplash, local assets) are loading correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Errors**: Check the Vercel logs. Common issues include missing dependencies or type errors.
- **Database Connection**: Verify your environment variables are correct.
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure your Supabase project allows requests from your production domain.

==================================================

# Google OAuth Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before Google OAuth will work, you need to configure it in your Supabase project.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Enable Google Provider in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Providers**
3. Find **Google** in the list and click to expand
4. Toggle **Enable Sign in with Google** to ON

### 2. Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
4. Click **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
5. Configure the OAuth consent screen if prompted
6. Select **Web application** as the application type
7. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   ```
   https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```
   Replace `<your-project-ref>` with your actual Supabase project reference

### 3. Configure Supabase with Google Credentials

1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google Cloud Console
2. Go back to Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Google**
3. Paste the **Client ID** in the appropriate field
4. Paste the **Client Secret** in the appropriate field
5. Click **Save**

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` file has:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Or your production URL: https://yourdomain.com
```

### 5. Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/auth/login` or `/auth/register`
3. Click the **Continue with Google** button
4. You should be redirected to Google's OAuth consent screen
5. After authorizing, you'll be redirected back to your app

## How It Works

### Login Flow

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" button
2. `loginWithGoogle()` server action is called
3. Supabase initiates OAuth flow with Google
4. User is redirected to Google's consent screen
5. After authorization, Google redirects to `/auth/callback`
6. Callback route exchanges code for session
7. If it's a new user, a profile is automatically created
8. User is redirected to dashboard

### Profile Creation

For OAuth users, the callback handler automatically creates a profile if one doesn't exist:

- Extracts name from Google user metadata
- Splits into first name and last name
- Sets role to 'student'
- Creates profile record in database

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication Error" Page

If users see the auth error page, check:

- Google OAuth credentials are correctly configured in Supabase
- Redirect URI matches exactly (including https/http)
- Google Cloud Console project has the OAuth consent screen configured
- User didn't cancel the authorization

### Profile Not Created

If OAuth login works but profile isn't created:

- Check Supabase logs for errors
- Verify the profiles table has proper RLS policies
- Ensure the callback route has permission to insert profiles

## Files Modified

- `src/app/(public)/auth/actions/index.ts` - Added `loginWithGoogle()` server action
- `src/app/(public)/auth/login/page.tsx` - Added Google OAuth button
- `src/app/(public)/auth/register/page.tsx` - Added Google OAuth button
- `src/app/(public)/auth/callback/route.ts` - OAuth callback handler (NEW)
- `src/app/(public)/auth/auth-error/page.tsx` - Error page (NEW)

# Homepage Dynamic Universities - Fixed! ✅

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

Universities on homepage were not accessible and data was not fully dynamic.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Database Query Updated**

Added all necessary fields to the universities query:

```typescript
// Before
.select(`
    id,
    name,
    city,
    description
`)

// After
.select(`
    id,
    name,
    slug,              // ✅ For SEO-friendly URLs
    city,
    province,          // ✅ Full location
    description,
    logo_url,          // ✅ University logo
    founded,           // ✅ Founded year
    total_students,    // ✅ Student count
    ranking            // ✅ University ranking
`)
```

### 2. **University Interface Updated**

```typescript
interface University {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string; // ✅ NEW
  city: string;
  province?: string; // ✅ NEW
  description: string;
  logo_url?: string; // ✅ NEW
  founded?: string; // ✅ NEW
  total_students?: string; // ✅ NEW
  ranking?: string; // ✅ NEW
}
```

### 3. **University Cards Made Dynamic**

#### Logo/Image:

```typescript
// Before: Static placeholder
src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-..."

// After: Dynamic from database
src={uni.logo_url || "fallback-image-url"}
```

#### Ranking Badge:

```typescript
// Before: Always "Top Ranked"
<div>Top Ranked</div>

// After: Dynamic from database
{uni.ranking && (
    <div>{uni.ranking}</div>
)}
```

#### Location:

```typescript
// Before: Only city
<span>{uni.city}</span>

// After: City + Province
<span>{uni.city}{uni.province && `, ${uni.province}`}</span>
```

#### Stats:

```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded
<span>50+</span>  // Programs
<span>10k+</span> // Students

// After: Dynamic from database
{uni.founded && (
    <div>Founded: {uni.founded}</div>
)}
{uni.total_students && (
    <div>Students: {uni.total_students}</div>
)}
```

#### Description:

```typescript
// Before: No description shown

// After: Dynamic description
{uni.description && (
    <p className="line-clamp-2">{uni.description}</p>
)}
```

#### Link:

```typescript
// Before: Using ID
href={`/universities/${uni.id}`}

// After: Using slug (SEO-friendly)
href={`/universities/${uni.slug}`}
```

  const file = e.target.files?.[0];

  // Validate file type
  if (!file.type.startsWith("image/")) {

    return;
  }

  // Validate file size (max 5MB)
  if (file.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024) {
    toast.error("Image size should be less than 5MB");
    return;
  }

  // Create preview
  const reader = new FileReader();

    setLogoPreview(reader.result as string);
  };
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);

  toast.success("Logo uploaded successfully");
};
```

### Gallery Upload Handler:

```typescript
const handleGalleryUpload = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const files = Array.from(e.target.files || []);

  // Validate total images (max 10)
  if (galleryPreviews.length + files.length > 10) {
    toast.error("Maximum 10 images allowed in gallery");
    return;
  }

  // Process each file
  files.forEach((file) => {
    // Validate and create preview
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onloadend = () => {
      setGalleryPreviews((prev) => [...prev, reader.result as string]);
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  });

  toast.success(`${files.length} image(s) added to gallery`);
};
```

### Remove Gallery Image:

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Admin Panel:

- [ ] Create new program (select from catalog)
- [ ] Edit existing program
- [ ] Delete program
- [ ] View programs list

### Public Pages:

- [ ] Homepage - featured programs display
- [ ] Programs list page - all programs display
- [ ] Program detail page - single program
- [ ] University detail page - programs list
- [ ] Universities list page - program counts
- [ ] Application form - program info

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. **Old Data Migration**

If you have existing data in the old `programs` table, you need to:

1. Create entries in `program_catalog` for unique programs
2. Migrate data to `university_programs` with `program_catalog_id`
3. Drop or rename old `programs` table

### 2. **View Dependency**

All public pages now depend on `v_university_programs_full` view. Make sure this view exists in your database by running:

```sql
-- Check if view exists
SELECT * FROM v_university_programs_full LIMIT 1;
```

### 3. **Active Programs Only**

Most queries now filter by `is_active = true`. Make sure to set this field when creating programs.

---

## 📝 Migration SQL (If Needed)

If you need to migrate old data:

```sql
-- 1. Insert unique programs into catalog
INSERT INTO program_catalog (title, category, level, typical_duration)
SELECT DISTINCT
    title,
    'Uncategorized' as category,
    level,
    duration as typical_duration
FROM programs
ON CONFLICT (title) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Migrate to university_programs
INSERT INTO university_programs (
    university_id,
    program_catalog_id,
    tuition_fee,
    currency,
    duration,
    language_id,
    intake,
    is_active
)
SELECT
    p.university_id,
    pc.id as program_catalog_id,
    p.tuition_fee,
    COALESCE(p.currency, 'RMB') as currency,
    p.duration,
    p.language_id,
    p.intake,
    COALESCE(p.is_active, true) as is_active
FROM programs p
JOIN program_catalog pc ON pc.title = p.title AND pc.level = p.level;

-- 3. Verify migration
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM university_programs;

-- 4. (Optional) Rename old table
ALTER TABLE programs RENAME TO programs_old_backup;
```

---

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

All files have been updated to use the new system. No files are using the old `programs` table anymore.

**Date:** November 28, 2025
**Migration Status:** ✅ Complete
**Files Updated:** 9 files
**Tables Updated:** 3 tables (program_catalog, university_programs, v_university_programs_full)

==================================================
FILE: ./docs/PROGRAM_CATALOG_FIXES.md
==================================================

# Program Catalog Page - Fixes Applied ✅

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Edit Button Not Working** ✅

**Problem:** Edit button had no functionality
**Solution:**

- Added `handleEdit()` function that:
  - Sets the program being edited
  - Populates form with program data
  - Opens the dialog

### 2. **No Loading States** ✅

**Problem:** No visual feedback during loading/saving
**Solution:**

- Added `loading` state for page load
- Added `saving` state for form submission
- Added loading spinner with text
- Disabled buttons during save
- Loading icon on submit button

## ✨ New Features Added

### 1. **Working Edit Functionality**

```tsx
// Click Edit button → Opens dialog with program data
<Button onClick={() => handleEdit(program)}>
  <Edit className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Edit
</Button>
```

### 2. **Loading States**

#### Page Loading:

```tsx
if (loading) {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
      <Loader2 className="h-12 w-12 animate-spin" />
      <p>Loading programs...</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Button Loading:

```tsx
<Button type="submit" disabled={saving}>
  {saving && <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />}
  {editingProgram ? "Update Program" : "Add Program"}
</Button>
```

### 3. **Proper State Management**

- `loading` - Page loading state

# Program Catalog System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### The Issue:

When universities add programs independently, they use different names for the same program:

- University A: "Business Administration"
- University B: "Business Management"
- University C: "BA in Business"

**Result:** These are the SAME program but appear as 3 different programs in filters and searches! ❌

## ✅ Solution: Centralized Program Catalog

### Two-Table Architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────────┐
│   program_catalog       │         │  university_programs     │
│  (Master List)          │◄────────│  (University Offerings)  │
├─────────────────────────┤         ├──────────────────────────┤

                                    └──────────────────────────┘
```

## 📊 Database Tables

### 1. `program_catalog` (Master List)

**Purpose:** Standardized, centralized list of all academic programs

**Fields:**

- `id` - Unique identifier
- `title` - **Standardized program name** (e.g., "Business Administration")
- `category` - Main category (e.g., "Business & Management")
- `field` - Sub-category (e.g., "General Business")
- `level` - Bachelor, Master, PhD
- `description` - Program description
- `typical_duration` - Standard duration (e.g., "4 years")

**Example Entry:**

```sql
{
  id: "uuid-123",
  title: "Business Administration",
  category: "Business & Management",
  field: "General Business",
  level: "Bachelor",
  description: "Comprehensive business education...",
  typical_duration: "4 years"
}
```

### 2. `university_programs` (University Offerings)

**Purpose:** Links universities to programs with their specific details

**Fields:**

- `id` - Unique identifier
- `university_id` - Which university offers this
- `program_catalog_id` - Which standard program (FK to program_catalog)
- `custom_title` - University's own name (optional)
- `tuition_fee` - University-specific fee
- `currency` - RMB, USD, etc.
- `duration` - Can override typical duration
- `language_id` - Language of instruction
- `intake` - Enrollment periods
- `scholarship_chance` - Scholarship availability

**Example Entry:**

```sql
{
  id: "uuid-456",
  university_id: "tsinghua-uuid",
  program_catalog_id: "uuid-123", // Links to "Business Administration"
  custom_title: "Business Management", // Tsinghua calls it this
  tuition_fee: 30000,
  currency: "RMB",
  duration: "4 years",
  language_id: "english-uuid",
  is_active: true
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Admin Workflow:

#### Step 1: Create Program Catalog (One Time)

Admin goes to **Program Catalog** page and adds standardized programs:

- Business Administration
- Computer Science
- MBBS
- etc.

#### Step 2: Universities Add Programs

When adding a program for a university:

1. Select university
2. **Choose from Program Catalog** (dropdown)
3. Add university-specific details:

==================================================

# Program Slug Implementation Guide

## Overview

Implemented slug-based routing for program pages with format: `program-name-university-name`

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration

**File:** `DATABASE_MIGRATION_ADD_PROGRAM_SLUG.sql`

- Added `slug` column to `university_programs` table
- Created `generate_program_slug()` function to generate SEO-friendly slugs
- Created automatic trigger to generate slugs on insert/update
- Updated `v_university_programs_full` view to include slug field
- Added index on slug column for performance

**Slug Format:** `{program-title}-{university-name}`

- Example: `computer-science-tsinghua-university`
- Example: `business-administration-peking-university`

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### New Route

- **Created:** `/src/app/(public)/programs/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Replaced ID-based routing with slug-based routing
- Queries database using `slug` instead of `id`
- Better SEO and user-friendly URLs

#### Updated Components

- **ProgramCard.tsx:** Updated to use `slug` in links (fallback to `id` if slug not available)
- **programs/page.tsx:** Added `slug` field to formatted program data

### 3. Old Route

The old `/programs/[id]/page.tsx` route still exists for backward compatibility, but new links will use the slug-based route.

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database and run:
psql -h your-db-host -U postgres -d postgres -f DATABASE_MIGRATION_ADD_PROGRAM_SLUG.sql
```

Or via Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `DATABASE_MIGRATION_ADD_PROGRAM_SLUG.sql`
3. Execute the SQL

### Step 2: Verify Migration

Check that slugs were generated:

```sql
SELECT id, slug, custom_title FROM university_programs LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 3: Test the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit:

- Old URL: `http://localhost:3000/programs/820d4cdc-0bb6-491b-8eb8-7b86784f96a9` (still works via old route)
- New URL: `http://localhost:3000/programs/computer-science-tsinghua-university` (new slug-based route)

## Benefits

1. **SEO Friendly:** Descriptive URLs help search engines understand page content
2. **User Friendly:** Users can read and understand the URL
3. **Shareable:** URLs are more memorable and shareable
4. **Unique:** Combines program name + university name to ensure uniqueness

## Example URLs

Before:

- `/programs/820d4cdc-0bb6-491b-8eb8-7b86784f96a9`

After:

- `/programs/computer-science-tsinghua-university`
- `/programs/mba-master-of-business-administration-peking-university`
- `/programs/mbbs-bachelor-of-medicine-bachelor-of-surgery-fudan-university`

## Backward Compatibility

The old `[id]` route is still functional, so existing bookmarks and links will continue to work. However, all new links generated by the application will use the slug-based format.

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Redirect old URLs:** Add a redirect from `/programs/[id]` to `/programs/[slug]`
2. **Remove old route:** Once all traffic is migrated, remove the `[id]` folder
3. **Add canonical tags:** Ensure SEO tools recognize the slug-based URL as canonical

# Program Catalog System - Visual Guide

## 🎯 The Problem (Before)

```
❌ OLD SYSTEM - Each university creates their own programs

Tsinghua University:
  ├─ "Business Administration" (30,000 RMB)
  ├─ "Computer Science" (35,000 RMB)
  └─ "MBBS" (50,000 RMB)

Peking University:
  ├─ "Business Management" ← SAME as Business Admin!
  ├─ "CS Program" ← SAME as Computer Science!
  └─ "Medicine (MBBS)" ← SAME as MBBS!

Fudan University:
  ├─ "BA in Business" ← SAME as Business Admin!
  ├─ "Software & Computing" ← SAME as Computer Science!
  └─ "Medical Degree" ← SAME as MBBS!

RESULT: 9 "different" programs but actually only 3! 😱
Filter by "Business" → Only finds 1 out of 3!
```

- `Bachelor`/`Master`/`PhD` → Full form (Identity, Contact, Address, Education, Language, Emergency Contact)
- `Non-Degree` → Minimal form (Identity, Contact only)

**Configuration Module** (`/src/components/applications/formConfig.ts`):
- `normalizeLevel(level)` — maps raw level strings to canonical types
- `isSectionVisible(section, level)` / `isFieldVisible(field, level)` — guards for conditional rendering
- `getRequiredFields(level)` — returns only required fields for the current level
- Validation (`getMissingFields`) is config-driven

**Steps:**

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Registration Flow

1. User fills registration form (`/auth/register`)
2. Form data includes: email, password, firstName, lastName
3. `signup()` action creates user with metadata:
   ```typescript
   {
     first_name: firstName,
     last_name: lastName,
     full_name: `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
     role: "student"
   }
   ```
4. Email confirmation sent
5. Redirects to login with returnUrl preserved

### Login Flow

1. User enters credentials (`/auth/login`)
2. `login()` action authenticates
3. Redirects to `returnUrl` or `/dashboard`
4. Navbar updates to show user profile

### Auth State Management

- **Server-side:** `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/server`
- **Client-side:** `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/client`
- **Auth listener:** `onAuthStateChange()` in Navbar

---

## 📝 Application Submission Flow

### 1. User Clicks "Apply Now"

- From program page or university page
- Redirects to `/apply/[programSlug]`

### 2. Authentication Check

```typescript
const {
  data: { user },
} = await supabase.auth.getUser();
if (!user) {
  redirect(`/auth/login?returnUrl=/apply/${programSlug}`);
}
```

### 3. Existing Application Check

```typescript
const { data: existingApplication } = await supabase
  .from("applications")
  .select("id, status")
  .eq("student_id", user.id)
  .eq("university_program_id", program.id)
  .single();

if (existingApplication) {
  redirect(`/apply/${programSlug}`); // Show existing application
}
```

### 4. Form Pre-filling

Data from `user.user_metadata`:

- `full_name` → student_name
- `email` → student_email
- `phone` → student_phone
- `country` → student_country
- `phone_country_code` → phoneCountryCode

### 5. Document Upload

```typescript
const fileName = `${user.id}/${requirementId}/${Date.now()}.${fileExt}`;
await supabase.storage.from("application-documents").upload(fileName, file);
```

### 6. Application Submission

```typescript
const { data: application } = await supabase
  .from("applications")
  .insert({
    student_id: user.id,
    university_program_id: program.id,
    student_phone: `${phoneCountryCode} ${formData.student_phone}`,
    status: requiresPayment ? "pending_payment" : "submitted",
    // ... other fields
  })
  .select()
  .single();
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Page Not Found" on `/dashboard/applications`

**Solution:** This route doesn't exist. Use `/dashboard` instead.

### Issue: Name not pre-filled in application form

**Solution:** Ensure `full_name` is saved during registration in `signup()` action.

### Issue: Duplicate key errors in country codes

**Solution:** Use unique `id` field for React keys, not `code`.

### Issue: Auth redirect not working

**Solution:** Check `returnUrl` parameter is preserved through registration → login flow.

2. Click "Add Scholarship Type"
3. Fill in the form:
   ```
   Name: Type A
   Display Name: Full Scholarship (Type A)
   Description: Best option for complete tuition coverage
   Coverage: 100%
   Service Fee USD: 3500
   Service Fee CNY: 25000
   ```
4. Add benefits:
   - "100% tuition fee coverage"
   - "Application support & guidance"
   - "Visa assistance"
   - "Pre-departure orientation"
5. Set as Active
6. Click "Save Changes"

### Editing an Existing Type

1. Go to `/admin/scholarship-types`
2. Click "Edit" on any scholarship type
3. Modify the fields you want to change
4. Click "Save Changes"

### Managing Display Order

- Lower numbers appear first
- Example:
  - Type A: Display Order = 1 (appears first)
  - Type B: Display Order = 2
  - Type C: Display Order = 3
  - Self-Funded: Display Order = 4 (appears last)

## Where Scholarship Types Appear

Once you create or edit scholarship types in the admin, they automatically appear on:

1. **University Detail Pages** (`/universities/[slug]`)
   - Shows after the programs list
   - Section title: "Available Scholarship Options"

2. **Program Detail Pages** (`/programs/[slug]`)
   - Shows after admission requirements
   - Section title: "Scholarship Options for This Program"

3. **Scholarships Page** (`/scholarships`)
   - Full page dedicated to explaining all types
   - Includes FAQs and required documents

## Database Structure

The scholarship types are stored in the `scholarship_types` table with these fields:

- `id` - Unique identifier
- `name` - Short name (e.g., "Type A")
- `display_name` - Full name shown to users
- `description` - Brief description
- `tuition_coverage_percentage` - 0-100%
- `service_fee_usd` - Fee in USD
- `service_fee_cny` - Fee in CNY
- `includes_accommodation` - Boolean
- `includes_stipend` - Boolean
- `stipend_amount_monthly` - Decimal
- `benefits` - JSONB array of strings
- `requirements` - JSONB array of strings
- `is_active` - Boolean (show/hide)
- `display_order` - Integer (sort order)

## Pre-populated Types

The database migration includes 4 default scholarship types:

1. **Type A (100%)** - $3,500 / ¥25,000
2. **Type B (75%)** - $2,800 / ¥20,000
3. **Type C (50%)** - $2,200 / ¥16,000
4. **Self-Funded (0%)** - $1,500 / ¥11,000

You can edit these or create new ones as needed.

## Tips

1. **Keep names short** - "Type A" is better than "Type A Full Scholarship"
2. **Use display names for clarity** - "Full Scholarship (Type A)" tells students exactly what it is
3. **Be specific in benefits** - List exactly what's included
4. **Update service fees regularly** - Keep pricing current
5. **Use display order** - Put most popular options first
6. **Test before activating** - Create as inactive, preview, then activate

## Support

If you need to:

- Add new fields to scholarship types
- Create custom scholarship applications
- Generate reports on scholarship usage

Contact your developer for database schema updates.

==================================================
FILE: ./docs/SETUP_COMMUNICATION_SYSTEM.md
==================================================

# Setup Communication System

## 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create Database Tables

You need to run the SQL script to create the messaging and payment tables.

**Go to Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the entire content of `DATABASE_ADD_COMMUNICATION_PAYMENT.sql`
6. Click **Run** or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`

This will create:

- ✅ `application_messages` table
- ✅ `payment_transactions` table
- ✅ `email_notifications` table
- ✅ `notification_preferences` table
- ✅ `document_requests` table
- ✅ `acceptance_letters` table
- ✅ `interview_schedules` table
- ✅ All triggers and RLS policies

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created

Run this query to check:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN (
    'application_messages',
    'payment_transactions',
    'email_notifications',
    'notification_preferences',
    'document_requests',
    'acceptance_letters',
    'interview_schedules'
);
```

You should see all 7 tables listed.

### Step 3: Test Messaging

Once tables are created, the admin can:

1. Go to admin dashboard
2. View an application
3. Send a message
4. Student will see it in their dashboard

---

## 📧 Email Notifications

Currently, emails are **logged to database** but not actually sent.

### To Enable Real Email Sending:

#### Option 1: Using Resend (Recommended)

1. **Sign up for Resend:**
   - Go to https://resend.com
   - Create account (free tier: 100 emails/day)
   - Get API key

2. **Install Resend:**

   ```bash
   npm install resend
   ```

3. **Add to `.env.local`:**

   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

4. **Uncomment code in `/src/lib/email/service.ts`:**

   ```typescript
   // Find this section and uncomment:
   const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
   const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
     from: "StudyAtChina <noreply@studyatchina.com>",
     to: params.to,
     subject: params.subject,
     html: params.html,
     text: params.text,
   });
   ```

5. **Update status from 'sent' to 'pending':**
   ```typescript
   status: 'pending', // Will be 'sent' after Resend confirms
   ```

#### Option 2: Using SendGrid

1. Sign up at https://sendgrid.com
2. Get API key
3. Install: `npm install @sendgrid/mail`
4. Add to `.env.local`: `SENDGRID_API_KEY=xxx`
5. Update `/src/lib/email/service.ts` to use SendGrid

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No messages showing for student"

**Check:**

1. ✅ Tables created in database
2. ✅ Message was actually created (check Supabase table)
3. ✅ Student is logged in with correct account
4. ✅ RLS policies allow student to see their messages

**Verify message exists:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM application_messages
WHERE application_id = 'your-application-id';
```

### "Email not sent"

**Current behavior:**

- Emails are logged to `email_notifications` table
- Status will be 'sent' (but not actually sent)
- To actually send, integrate Resend or SendGrid (see above)

**Check email logs:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM email_notifications
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### "Student can't see messages"

**Check RLS policy:**

```sql
-- This should return the student's messages
SELECT m.*
FROM application_messages m
JOIN applications a ON a.id = m.application_id
WHERE a.student_id = 'student-user-id';
```

## 📱 Admin Send Message Feature

Currently, the admin dashboard doesn't have a UI to send messages yet.

## 🌐 URL Examples

### Real-World Examples:

| University              | Old URL                  | New URL                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Tsinghua University** | `/universities/uuid-123` | `/universities/tsinghua-university`           |
| **Peking University**   | `/universities/uuid-456` | `/universities/peking-university`             |
| **Fudan University**    | `/universities/uuid-789` | `/universities/fudan-university`              |
| **Shanghai Jiao Tong**  | `/universities/uuid-abc` | `/universities/shanghai-jiao-tong-university` |

---

## ✅ Benefits

### 1. **SEO Friendly**

```
✅ tsinghua-university (descriptive)
❌ 59a89e04-1821-44c4-8307-22717c4e3c3b (meaningless)
```

### 2. **User Friendly**

- Easy to read
- Easy to remember
- Easy to share
- Professional appearance

### 3. **Better Analytics**

- Track by university name
- Clearer URL patterns
- Better reporting

### 4. **Social Sharing**

```
When shared on social media:
✅ "Check out Tsinghua University"
   /universities/tsinghua-university

❌ "Check out this university"
   /universities/59a89e04-1821-44c4-8307-22717c4e3c3b
```

---

## 📊 Slug Format

### Slug Generation Rules:

```typescript
// Example slug generation
const generateSlug = (name: string) => {
    return name
        .toLowerCase()                    // tsinghua university
        .replace(/\s+/g, '-')            // tsinghua-university
        .replace(/[^\w\-]+/g, '')        // remove special chars
        .replace(/\-\-+/g, '-')          // single dashes
        .replace(/^-+/, '')              // trim start
        .replace(/-+$/, '');             // trim end
};

// Examples:
"Tsinghua University" → "tsinghua-university"
"Shanghai Jiao Tong University" → "shanghai-jiao-tong-university"
"Beijing Normal University" → "beijing-normal-university"
```

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### URL Flow:

```
1. User clicks link:
   /universities/tsinghua-university

2. Next.js routes to:
   /app/(public)/universities/[slug]/page.tsx

3. Page receives params:
   { slug: "tsinghua-university" }

4. Database query:
   SELECT * FROM universities WHERE slug = 'tsinghua-university'

5. Page renders with university data
```

---

## 🛠️ Admin Panel

### Admin URLs (Still use ID):

```
Admin Edit: /admin/universities/[id]
Reason: Internal use, ID is more reliable
```

### Public URLs (Use Slug):

```
Public View: /universities/[slug]
Reason: User-facing, SEO-friendly
```

---

## 📝 Database Requirements

### Universities Table:

```sql
-- Slug column should exist
ALTER TABLE universities
ADD COLUMN slug VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE;

-- Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_universities_slug ON universities(slug);

-- Ensure slugs are unique
ALTER TABLE universities
ADD CONSTRAINT universities_slug_unique UNIQUE (slug);
```

### Example Data:

```sql
INSERT INTO universities (name, slug, city) VALUES
('Tsinghua University', 'tsinghua-university', 'Beijing'),
('Peking University', 'peking-university', 'Beijing'),
('Fudan University', 'fudan-university', 'Shanghai');
```

---

## 🔄 Migration Steps

### If you have existing universities without slugs:

```sql
-- Generate slugs from existing names
UPDATE universities
SET slug = LOWER(REPLACE(REPLACE(name, ' ', '-'), '.', ''))
WHERE slug IS NULL;

-- Verify uniqueness
SELECT slug, COUNT(*)
FROM universities
GROUP BY slug
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Fix duplicates manually if any
```

---

## 🎯 URL Patterns

### All University URLs:

```
Homepage Featured:
/universities/tsinghua-university

University List:
/universities/peking-university

Search Results:
/universities/fudan-university

Program Links:
/universities/shanghai-jiao-tong-university
```

---

## ✅ Checklist

- ✅ Route folder renamed to `[slug]`
- ✅ Page component updated to use slug
- ✅ Database query changed to `eq("slug", slug)`
- ✅ UniversityCard links updated
- ✅ FeaturedUniversities links updated
- ✅ All university links use slug
- ✅ SEO-friendly URLs
- ✅ User-friendly URLs

---

## 🚀 Result

**Professional, SEO-friendly URLs** that are:

- ✅ Easy to read
- ✅ Easy to share
- ✅ Better for SEO
- ✅ More professional
- ✅ User-friendly

### Example:

```
Before: /universities/59a89e04-1821-44c4-8307-22717c4e3c3b
After:  /universities/tsinghua-university
```

**Much better!** 🎉

console.log("Programs:", university.programs);
console.log("Programs length:", university.programs?.length);
```

### Step 5: Save

### Step 6: Repeat

## Where Scholarships Appear

Once you add scholarships for a university, they automatically appear on:

1. **University Detail Page** (`/universities/[slug]`)
   - Section: "Available Scholarship Options"
   - Shows after programs list

2. **All Program Pages for That University** (`/programs/[slug]`)
   - Section: "Scholarship Options for This Program"
   - Shows after admission requirements

3. **Dynamic Display**
   - Only active scholarships are shown
   - Sorted by display_order
   - Shows all benefits clearly

## Migration Instructions

### 1. Run the Database Migration

Execute the SQL file:

```sql
-- File: DATABASE_MIGRATION_UNIVERSITY_SCHOLARSHIPS.sql
```

This will:

- Drop old `scholarship_types` table
- Create new `university_scholarships` table
- Set up proper relationships and indexes

### 2. Add Scholarships via Admin

For each university:

1. Go to `/admin/universities`
2. Click "Scholarships"
3. Add each scholarship type
4. Fill in all details
5. Save

### 3. Verify Frontend

Visit:

- Any university page
- Any program page for that university
- Check that scholarships display correctly

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Be Specific in Descriptions**
   - Good: "Free tuition, free accommodation on campus and 2500RMB/month stipend"
   - Bad: "Good scholarship"

2. **Use Consistent Naming**
   - If one university uses "Type A, B, C", stick with that pattern
   - If another uses descriptive names, that's fine too

3. **Set Display Order**
   - Put most attractive scholarships first (usually highest coverage)
   - Example: Type A (100%) = 1, Type B (75%) = 2, etc.

4. **Include Duration**
   - Always specify if it's 1 year or 4 years
   - This is crucial information for students

5. **Service Fees**
   - Keep USD and CNY in sync (approximately)
   - Update regularly if exchange rates change significantly

6. **Test Before Activating**
   - Create scholarship as inactive
   - Check the preview
   - Then activate

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Scholarships not showing on university page?**

- Check if scholarships are marked as "Active"
- Verify university_id is correct
- Check browser console for errors

**Q: How to delete a scholarship?**

- Currently, set it to "Inactive" to hide it
- Or delete directly from database if needed

**Q: Can I copy scholarships from one university to another?**

- Not via UI currently
- Can duplicate in database and change university_id

**Q: What if a university has no scholarships?**

- That's fine! The section will show "No scholarships available"
- Or you can add a generic "Contact us" scholarship type

## Support

For additional features or customizations:

- Adding bulk import for scholarships
- Copying scholarships between universities
- Custom scholarship application forms
- Integration with payment systems

==================================================

# Admin Password Reset Guide

## 🔐 How to Reset Admin Password

There are **4 methods** to reset the admin password. Choose the one that works best for you:

---

## Method 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Easiest) ⭐

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Users**
4. Find the admin user (usually `admin@studyatchina.com`)
5. Click the **three dots (...)** menu next to the user
6. Select **"Send password reset email"**
7. Check the admin email inbox
8. Click the reset link and set a new password

**Pros:** Simple, secure, no coding required
**Cons:** Requires email access

---

## Method 2: Using Node.js Script (Recommended) ⭐

I've created a script for you at `/scripts/reset-admin-password.js`

### Steps:

1. **Ensure you have the Service Role Key:**

   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```

   Get this from: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → service_role key

2. **Install dependencies (if not already installed):**

   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js dotenv
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   node scripts/reset-admin-password.js
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Enter admin email (or press Enter for default)
   - Enter new password (min 6 characters)
   - Confirm password

5. **Save the credentials shown!**

**Pros:** Quick, automated, can create new admin if needed
**Cons:** Requires Service Role Key

---

## Method 3: Using Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **SQL Editor**
2. Run this query to find the admin user:

   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, raw_user_meta_data
   FROM auth.users
   WHERE email = 'admin@studyatchina.com';
   ```

3. Copy the user ID

4. Use Supabase Auth API to reset password:
   - You cannot directly update passwords via SQL for security
   - Use Method 1 or Method 2 instead

**Note:** SQL method is limited due to security restrictions

---

## Method 4: Create New Admin User

If you can't access the existing admin account, create a new one:

### Via Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Click **"Add user"**
3. Enter email: `newadmin@studyatchina.com`
4. Enter password
5. Check **"Auto Confirm User"**
6. Click **"Create user"**

7. Then update user metadata via SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   UPDATE auth.users
   SET
       raw_user_meta_data = jsonb_set(
           COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb),
           '{role}',
           '"admin"'
       )
   WHERE email = 'newadmin@studyatchina.com';
   ```

### Via Node.js Script:

Run the script and choose to create a new admin when prompted:

```bash
node scripts/reset-admin-password.js
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Admin Access

After resetting the password, verify it works:

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
2. Enter admin email and new password
3. You should be redirected to admin dashboard

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "User not found"

- Check the email is correct
- Verify user exists in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- Create a new admin user using Method 4

### "Invalid credentials"

- Password was not updated correctly
- Try Method 1 (password reset email)
- Ensure email is confirmed (check `email_confirmed_at` in database)

### "Missing Service Role Key"

- Get it from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
- Add to `.env.local` as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Important:** This is different from the `anon` key!

### "Password too weak"

- Supabase requires minimum 6 characters
- Use a strong password with letters, numbers, and symbols

---

## 📋 Default Admin Credentials

If you just set up the project, the default admin might be:

**Email:** `admin@studyatchina.com`
**Password:** (whatever you set during initial setup)

If you don't remember, use one of the reset methods above.

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Use a strong password:**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Don't reuse passwords

2. **Keep Service Role Key secure:**
   - Never commit to Git
   - Only in `.env.local` (which is gitignored)
   - Has full database access!

3. **Enable 2FA (if available):**
   - Check Supabase settings for 2FA options

4. **Regular password rotation:**
   - Change admin password every 90 days
   - Use a password manager

---

## 🎯 Quick Reset (TL;DR)

**Fastest method:**

```bash
# 1. Add Service Role Key to .env.local
# 2. Run script
node scripts/reset-admin-password.js

# 3. Follow prompts
# 4. Done! ✅
```

**Alternative (no coding):**

1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Find admin → Send password reset email
3. Check email → Reset password
4. Done! ✅

---

## 📞 Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure Supabase project is active
4. Check email spam folder for reset emails

# Admission Requirements Integration

## Overview

Successfully integrated the admission requirements system from the backend database into the program detail pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Program Page Updates (`/programs/[slug]/page.tsx`)

- **Fetches requirements from database** using `v_university_admission_requirements` view
- Filters requirements by:
  - University ID
  - Program level (Bachelor, Master, PhD, or "all")
- Groups requirements by category (academic, language, document, financial, other)
- Passes structured data to ProgramRequirements component

### 2. ProgramRequirements Component Updates

- **Enhanced to handle 5 categories:**
  - ✅ Academic Requirements
  - ✅ Language Requirements
  - ✅ Document Requirements
  - ✅ Financial Requirements (NEW)
  - ✅ Additional Information/Other (NEW)

- **Flexible data handling:**
  - Supports both string format (legacy)
  - Supports object format with `name`, `required`, and `note` fields

- **Visual improvements:**
  - Financial requirements with dollar icon
  - Additional info with info icon
  - Conditional rendering (only shows sections with data)
  - Better formatting for notes and descriptions

## Database Structure

### Tables Used:

1. **`admission_requirements_catalog`** - Master list of all requirements
2. **`university_admission_requirements`** - Junction table linking universities to requirements
3. **`v_university_admission_requirements`** - View for easy querying

### Requirement Categories:

- `academic` - Diplomas, GPA, transcripts
- `language` - IELTS, TOEFL, HSK scores
- `document` - Passport, photos, certificates
- `financial` - Bank statements, guarantees
- `other` - Age limits, health, interviews

### Requirement Types:

- `bachelor` - For undergraduate programs
- `master` - For graduate programs
- `phd` - For doctoral programs
- `all` - Applies to all levels

## How It Works

1. **User visits program page** → `/programs/computer-science-tsinghua-university`

2. **System fetches:**
   - Program details from `v_university_programs_full`
   - Admission requirements from `v_university_admission_requirements`

3. **Requirements are filtered by:**
   - University ID (e.g., Tsinghua University)
   - Program level (e.g., Bachelor + "all")

4. **Requirements are grouped by category** and displayed in organized sections

5. **Each requirement shows:**
   - Title (e.g., "IELTS 6.0")
   - Description (e.g., "IELTS score of 6.0 or above...")
   - Required/Optional status
   - Custom notes (if university added specific info)

## Benefits

✅ **Dynamic** - Requirements come from database, not hardcoded
✅ **Flexible** - Universities can customize requirements
✅ **Organized** - Clear categorization by type
✅ **Detailed** - Shows descriptions and notes
✅ **Accurate** - Level-specific requirements (Bachelor vs Master)
✅ **Maintainable** - Easy to update via admin panel

## Next Steps

To populate requirements for your universities:

1. **Run the migration** (if not already done):

   ```sql
   -- Execute DATABASE_MIGRATION_ADMISSION_REQUIREMENTS.sql
   ```

2. **Link requirements to universities** via admin panel or SQL:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO university_admission_requirements (university_id, requirement_id, is_required, display_order)
   SELECT
       (SELECT id FROM universities WHERE slug = 'your-university-slug'),
       id,
       true,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY category, title)
   FROM admission_requirements_catalog
   WHERE requirement_type IN ('bachelor', 'all')
   AND is_common = true;
   ```

3. **Customize as needed:**
   - Add custom notes for specific requirements
   - Mark some as optional
   - Adjust display order
   - Add university-specific requirements to the catalog

## Example Output

When viewing a Bachelor program at Tsinghua University, students will see:

### Entry Requirements

==================================================
FILE: ./docs/guides/AUTOMATIC_UNIVERSITY_DETECTION.md
==================================================

# Automatic University Detection in Articles

## 🎯 Feature Overview

The system now **automatically detects** when universities are mentioned in articles and displays them at the bottom of the article page!

## ✨ How It Works

### Automatic Detection:

1. **Scans Article Content:** The system reads both the article title and content
2. **Matches University Names:** Looks for exact matches of university names (both English and local names)
3. **Smart Matching:** Uses word boundaries to avoid partial matches
4. **Displays Results:** Shows all mentioned universities in beautiful cards at the bottom

### What Gets Detected:

- ✅ **English names** (e.g., "Tsinghua University")
- ✅ **Local names** (e.g., "清华大学")
- ✅ **Case-insensitive** matching
- ✅ **Whole word** matching (avoids false positives)

## 📝 Example Usage

### In Your Article:

```html
<h2>Top Universities in Beijing</h2>
<p>
  Beijing is home to many prestigious universities. Tsinghua University and
  Peking University are among the best in China...
</p>

<p>
  Another great option is Beijing Normal University, which specializes in
  education programs...
</p>
```

### Result:

The system will automatically detect and display cards for:

- Tsinghua University
- Peking University
- Beijing Normal University

## 🎨 Display Features

Each detected university is shown with:

- **University Logo** (or icon if no logo)
- **University Name** (English)
- **Local Name** (Chinese)
- **Location** (City, Province)
- **"View University" Button** (links to university page)
- **Hover Effects** (border highlight, shadow)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Detection Algorithm:

```typescript
// Searches for university names in article content
// Uses regex with word boundaries for accurate matching
// Example: "Tsinghua University" will match
// But "TsinghuaUniversity" won't match (needs spaces)
```

### Performance:

- ✅ Server-side detection (fast, no client-side processing)
- ✅ Only active universities are checked
- ✅ Cached university data
- ✅ No impact on page load speed

## 📋 Benefits

1. **SEO Boost:** Internal linking to university pages
2. **User Experience:** Easy navigation to mentioned universities
3. **Content Discovery:** Helps users find relevant universities
4. **Automatic:** No manual work required
5. **Smart:** Only shows when universities are actually mentioned

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Perfect For Articles About:

- **University Rankings:** "Top 10 Universities in China"
- **City Guides:** "Best Universities in Shanghai"
- **Program Guides:** "Where to Study Engineering in China"
- **Comparison Articles:** "Tsinghua vs Peking University"
- **Admission Guides:** "How to Apply to Fudan University"

## 💡 Tips for Writers

To ensure universities are detected:

1. **Use Full Names:** Write "Tsinghua University" not just "Tsinghua"
2. **Spell Correctly:** Match the exact name in the database
3. **Include Both Names:** Use both English and Chinese names for better detection
4. **Natural Writing:** Just write naturally - the system handles the rest!

## 🔄 How It Updates

- **Real-time:** Detection happens when the article page loads
- **Automatic:** No manual tagging needed
- **Dynamic:** If you update the article, universities update automatically
- **Smart:** Only shows universities that exist in your database

## 📊 Example Output

When an article mentions "Tsinghua University" and "Peking University":

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Universities Mentioned in This Article            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                     │
│  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐               │
│  │ [Logo]       │  │ [Logo]       │               │
│  │ Tsinghua     │  │ Peking       │               │
│  │ University   │  │ University   │               │
│  │ 清华大学      │  │ 北京大学      │               │
│  │ Beijing      │  │ Beijing      │               │
│  │ [View Univ]  │  │ [View Univ]  │               │
│  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

Possible improvements:

3. **Highlight Text:** Highlight university names in the article
4. **Related Programs:** Show programs from mentioned universities

```

### Program Catalog Table (New):

```sql
CREATE TABLE program_catalog (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    field VARCHAR(100),

---

## ✅ Verification Queries

### Check Universities Table:

```sql
-- Verify all columns exist
SELECT
    column_name,
    data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'universities'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

### Check Program Catalog:

```sql
-- Count programs in catalog
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_programs FROM program_catalog;

-- View programs by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count
FROM program_catalog
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Check Indexes:

```sql
-- Verify indexes exist
SELECT
    indexname,
    tablename
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('universities', 'program_catalog', 'university_programs');
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "column already exists"

```sql
-- This is OK! It means the column was already added
-- The migration uses IF NOT EXISTS to prevent errors
```

### Error: "relation does not exist"

```sql
-- Make sure you're running the migration in the correct database
-- Check that the universities table exists first
SELECT * FROM universities LIMIT 1;
```

### Error: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"

```sql
-- This means you have duplicate slugs
-- Run this to find duplicates:
SELECT slug, COUNT(*)
FROM universities
GROUP BY slug
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Fix by updating duplicates manually
```

---

## 📝 Sample Data

### Universities Sample:

```sql
INSERT INTO universities (
    name,
    name_local,
    slug,
    city,
    province,
    founded,

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. **Old Data Migration**

If you have existing data in the old `programs` table, you need to:

1. Create entries in `program_catalog` for unique programs
2. Migrate data to `university_programs` with `program_catalog_id`
3. Drop or rename old `programs` table

### 2. **View Dependency**

All public pages now depend on `v_university_programs_full` view. Make sure this view exists in your database by running:

```sql
-- Check if view exists
SELECT * FROM v_university_programs_full LIMIT 1;
```

### 3. **Active Programs Only**

Most queries now filter by `is_active = true`. Make sure to set this field when creating programs.

---

## 📝 Migration SQL (If Needed)

If you need to migrate old data:

```sql
-- 1. Insert unique programs into catalog
INSERT INTO program_catalog (title, category, level, typical_duration)
SELECT DISTINCT
    title,
    'Uncategorized' as category,
    level,
    duration as typical_duration
FROM programs
ON CONFLICT (title) DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Migrate to university_programs
INSERT INTO university_programs (
    university_id,
    program_catalog_id,
    tuition_fee,
    currency,
    duration,
    language_id,
    intake,
    is_active
)
SELECT
    p.university_id,
    pc.id as program_catalog_id,
    p.tuition_fee,
    COALESCE(p.currency, 'RMB') as currency,
    p.duration,
    p.language_id,
    p.intake,
    COALESCE(p.is_active, true) as is_active
FROM programs p
JOIN program_catalog pc ON pc.title = p.title AND pc.level = p.level;

-- 3. Verify migration
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM university_programs;

-- 4. (Optional) Rename old table
ALTER TABLE programs RENAME TO programs_old_backup;
```

---

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

All files have been updated to use the new system. No files are using the old `programs` table anymore.

**Date:** November 28, 2025
**Migration Status:** ✅ Complete
**Files Updated:** 9 files
**Tables Updated:** 3 tables (program_catalog, university_programs, v_university_programs_full)

# Program Catalog System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### The Issue:

When universities add programs independently, they use different names for the same program:

- University A: "Business Administration"
- University B: "Business Management"
- University C: "BA in Business"

**Result:** These are the SAME program but appear as 3 different programs in filters and searches! ❌

## ✅ Solution: Centralized Program Catalog

### Two-Table Architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────────┐
│   program_catalog       │         │  university_programs     │
│  (Master List)          │◄────────│  (University Offerings)  │
├─────────────────────────┤         ├──────────────────────────┤
│ • id                    │         │ • id                     │
│ • title                 │         │ • university_id          │
│ • category              │         │ • program_catalog_id ────┤
│ • field                 │         │ • custom_title           │

│ • description           │         │ • duration               │
│ • typical_duration      │         │ • language_id            │
└─────────────────────────┘         │ • scholarship_chance     │
                                    │ • is_active              │
                                    └──────────────────────────┘
```

## 📊 Database Tables

### 1. `program_catalog` (Master List)

**Purpose:** Standardized, centralized list of all academic programs

**Fields:**

- `id` - Unique identifier
- `title` - **Standardized program name** (e.g., "Business Administration")
- `category` - Main category (e.g., "Business & Management")
- `field` - Sub-category (e.g., "General Business")
- `level` - Bachelor, Master, PhD
- `description` - Program description
- `typical_duration` - Standard duration (e.g., "4 years")

**Example Entry:**

```sql
{
  id: "uuid-123",
  title: "Business Administration",
  category: "Business & Management",
  field: "General Business",
  level: "Bachelor",
  description: "Comprehensive business education...",
  typical_duration: "4 years"
}
```

### 2. `university_programs` (University Offerings)

**Purpose:** Links universities to programs with their specific details

**Fields:**

- `id` - Unique identifier
- `university_id` - Which university offers this
- `program_catalog_id` - Which standard program (FK to program_catalog)
- `custom_title` - University's own name (optional)
- `tuition_fee` - University-specific fee
- `currency` - RMB, USD, etc.
- `duration` - Can override typical duration
- `language_id` - Language of instruction
- `intake` - Enrollment periods
- `scholarship_chance` - Scholarship availability
- `application_fee` - Application cost
- `service_fee` - Service charge
- `is_active` - Active/Inactive status

**Example Entry:**

```sql
{
  id: "uuid-456",
  university_id: "tsinghua-uuid",
  program_catalog_id: "uuid-123", // Links to "Business Administration"
  custom_title: "Business Management", // Tsinghua calls it this
  tuition_fee: 30000,
  currency: "RMB",
  duration: "4 years",
  language_id: "english-uuid",
  is_active: true
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Admin Workflow:

#### Step 1: Create Program Catalog (One Time)

Admin goes to **Program Catalog** page and adds standardized programs:

- Business Administration
- Computer Science
- MBBS
- etc.

#### Step 2: Universities Add Programs

When adding a program for a university:

1. Select university
2. **Choose from Program Catalog** (dropdown)
3. Add university-specific details:
   - Tuition fee
   - Duration (if different)
   - Language
   - Custom title (if they call it something else)
4. Save

### Example Scenario:

**Tsinghua University adds "Business Administration":**

```
Program Catalog: Business Administration
Custom Title: "Business Management" (optional)
Tuition: 30,000 RMB

- ✅ Filter by category/level
- ✅ Search programs
- ✅ See how many universities offer each

### 2. University Programs Page (Updated)

**Route:** `/admin/programs`

**Features:**

- ✅ Select from Program Catalog (dropdown)
- ✅ Add university-specific details
- ✅ Optional custom title
- ✅ Set tuition, fees, duration
- ✅ Link to university

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Execute the SQL migration file
psql -d your_database < DATABASE_MIGRATION_PROGRAMS.sql
```

### 2. Migrate Existing Data

```sql
-- Map existing programs to catalog
-- This needs to be done carefully based on your data
```

### 3. Update Admin UI

- ✅ Program Catalog page (created)
- ✅ Update Programs page to use catalog selection
- ✅ Update university detail page

### 4. Update Public Pages

- Update filters to use categories
- Update search to use catalog
- Display program from catalog + university details

## 📊 Database View

A helpful view is created for easy querying:

```sql
v_university_programs_full
```

This view combines:

- University info
- Program catalog info
- University-specific details

**Usage:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM v_university_programs_full
WHERE category = 'Business & Management'
AND level = 'Bachelor'
AND is_active = true;
```

## 🎯 Example Queries

### Get all Business programs:

```sql
SELECT * FROM v_university_programs_full
WHERE category = 'Business & Management';
```

### Compare same program across universities:

```sql
SELECT
  university_name,
  tuition_fee,
  duration,
  language_name
FROM v_university_programs_full
WHERE program_title = 'Business Administration'
AND level = 'Bachelor'
ORDER BY tuition_fee;
```

### Most popular programs:

```sql
SELECT
  program_title,
  COUNT(*) as universities_offering
FROM v_university_programs_full
GROUP BY program_title
ORDER BY universities_offering DESC;
```

# Program Slug Implementation Guide

## Overview

Implemented slug-based routing for program pages with format: `program-name-university-name`

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration

**File:** `DATABASE_MIGRATION_ADD_PROGRAM_SLUG.sql`

- Added `slug` column to `university_programs` table
- Created `generate_program_slug()` function to generate SEO-friendly slugs
- Created automatic trigger to generate slugs on insert/update
- Updated `v_university_programs_full` view to include slug field
- Added index on slug column for performance

**Slug Format:** `{program-title}-{university-name}`

- Example: `computer-science-tsinghua-university`
- Example: `business-administration-peking-university`

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### New Route

- **Created:** `/src/app/(public)/programs/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Replaced ID-based routing with slug-based routing
- Queries database using `slug` instead of `id`
- Better SEO and user-friendly URLs

#### Updated Components

- **ProgramCard.tsx:** Updated to use `slug` in links (fallback to `id` if slug not available)
- **programs/page.tsx:** Added `slug` field to formatted program data

### 3. Old Route

The old `/programs/[id]/page.tsx` route still exists for backward compatibility, but new links will use the slug-based route.

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database and run:
psql -h your-db-host -U postgres -d postgres -f DATABASE_MIGRATION_ADD_PROGRAM_SLUG.sql
```

Or via Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `DATABASE_MIGRATION_ADD_PROGRAM_SLUG.sql`
3. Execute the SQL

### Step 2: Verify Migration

Check that slugs were generated:

```sql
SELECT id, slug, custom_title FROM university_programs LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 3: Test the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit:

- Old URL: `http://localhost:3000/programs/820d4cdc-0bb6-491b-8eb8-7b86784f96a9` (still works via old route)
- New URL: `http://localhost:3000/programs/computer-science-tsinghua-university` (new slug-based route)

## Benefits

1. **SEO Friendly:** Descriptive URLs help search engines understand page content
2. **User Friendly:** Users can read and understand the URL
3. **Shareable:** URLs are more memorable and shareable
4. **Unique:** Combines program name + university name to ensure uniqueness

## Example URLs

Before:

- `/programs/820d4cdc-0bb6-491b-8eb8-7b86784f96a9`

After:

- `/programs/computer-science-tsinghua-university`
- `/programs/mba-master-of-business-administration-peking-university`
- `/programs/mbbs-bachelor-of-medicine-bachelor-of-surgery-fudan-university`

## Backward Compatibility

The old `[id]` route is still functional, so existing bookmarks and links will continue to work. However, all new links generated by the application will use the slug-based format.

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Redirect old URLs:** Add a redirect from `/programs/[id]` to `/programs/[slug]`
2. **Remove old route:** Once all traffic is migrated, remove the `[id]` folder
3. **Add canonical tags:** Ensure SEO tools recognize the slug-based URL as canonical

# Program Catalog System - Visual Guide

## 🎯 The Problem (Before)

```
❌ OLD SYSTEM - Each university creates their own programs

Tsinghua University:
  ├─ "Business Administration" (30,000 RMB)
  ├─ "Computer Science" (35,000 RMB)
  └─ "MBBS" (50,000 RMB)

Peking University:
  ├─ "Business Management" ← SAME as Business Admin!
  ├─ "CS Program" ← SAME as Computer Science!
  └─ "Medicine (MBBS)" ← SAME as MBBS!

Fudan University:
  ├─ "BA in Business" ← SAME as Business Admin!
  ├─ "Software & Computing" ← SAME as Computer Science!
  └─ "Medical Degree" ← SAME as MBBS!

RESULT: 9 "different" programs but actually only 3! 😱
Filter by "Business" → Only finds 1 out of 3!
```

## ✅ The Solution (After)

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Registration Flow

1. User fills registration form (`/auth/register`)
2. Form data includes: email, password, firstName, lastName
3. `signup()` action creates user with metadata:
   ```typescript
   {
     first_name: firstName,
     last_name: lastName,
     full_name: `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
     role: "student"
   }
   ```
4. Email confirmation sent
5. Redirects to login with returnUrl preserved

### Login Flow

1. User enters credentials (`/auth/login`)
2. `login()` action authenticates
3. Redirects to `returnUrl` or `/dashboard`
4. Navbar updates to show user profile

### Auth State Management

- **Server-side:** `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/server`
- **Client-side:** `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/client`
- **Auth listener:** `onAuthStateChange()` in Navbar

---

## 📝 Application Submission Flow

### 1. User Clicks "Apply Now"

- From program page or university page
- Redirects to `/apply/[programSlug]`

### 2. Authentication Check

```typescript
const {
  data: { user },
} = await supabase.auth.getUser();
if (!user) {
  redirect(`/auth/login?returnUrl=/apply/${programSlug}`);
}
```

### 3. Existing Application Check

```typescript
const { data: existingApplication } = await supabase
  .from("applications")
  .select("id, status")
  .eq("student_id", user.id)
  .eq("university_program_id", program.id)
  .single();

if (existingApplication) {
  redirect(`/apply/${programSlug}`); // Show existing application
}
```

### 4. Form Pre-filling

Data from `user.user_metadata`:

- `full_name` → student_name
- `email` → student_email
- `phone` → student_phone
- `country` → student_country
- `phone_country_code` → phoneCountryCode

### 5. Document Upload

```typescript
const fileName = `${user.id}/${requirementId}/${Date.now()}.${fileExt}`;
await supabase.storage.from("application-documents").upload(fileName, file);
```

### 6. Application Submission

```typescript
const { data: application } = await supabase
  .from("applications")
  .insert({
    student_id: user.id,
    university_program_id: program.id,
    student_phone: `${phoneCountryCode} ${formData.student_phone}`,
    status: requiresPayment ? "pending_payment" : "submitted",
    // ... other fields
  })
  .select()
  .single();
```

5. **Dates:** ISO format with timezone

### RLS (Row Level Security)

- Students can only view/edit their own applications
- Admins can view/edit all applications
- Public can view universities and programs
- Documents are protected by RLS

### File Storage Structure

```
application-documents/
  └── {user_id}/
      └── {requirement_id}/
          └── {timestamp}.{ext}
```

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Page Not Found" on `/dashboard/applications`

**Solution:** This route doesn't exist. Use `/dashboard` instead.

### Issue: Name not pre-filled in application form

**Solution:** Ensure `full_name` is saved during registration in `signup()` action.

### Issue: Duplicate key errors in country codes

**Solution:** Use unique `id` field for React keys, not `code`.

### Issue: Auth redirect not working

**Solution:** Check `returnUrl` parameter is preserved through registration → login flow.

2. Click "Add Scholarship Type"
3. Fill in the form:
   ```
   Name: Type A
   Display Name: Full Scholarship (Type A)
   Description: Best option for complete tuition coverage
   Coverage: 100%
   Service Fee USD: 3500
   Service Fee CNY: 25000
   ```
4. Add benefits:
   - "100% tuition fee coverage"
   - "Application support & guidance"
   - "Visa assistance"
   - "Pre-departure orientation"
5. Set as Active
6. Click "Save Changes"

### Editing an Existing Type

1. Go to `/admin/scholarship-types`
2. Click "Edit" on any scholarship type
3. Modify the fields you want to change
4. Click "Save Changes"

### Managing Display Order

- Lower numbers appear first
- Example:
  - Type A: Display Order = 1 (appears first)
  - Type B: Display Order = 2
  - Type C: Display Order = 3
  - Self-Funded: Display Order = 4 (appears last)

## Where Scholarship Types Appear

Once you create or edit scholarship types in the admin, they automatically appear on:

1. **University Detail Pages** (`/universities/[slug]`)
   - Shows after the programs list
   - Section title: "Available Scholarship Options"

2. **Program Detail Pages** (`/programs/[slug]`)
   - Shows after admission requirements
   - Section title: "Scholarship Options for This Program"

3. **Scholarships Page** (`/scholarships`)
   - Full page dedicated to explaining all types
   - Includes FAQs and required documents

## Database Structure

The scholarship types are stored in the `scholarship_types` table with these fields:

- `id` - Unique identifier
- `name` - Short name (e.g., "Type A")
- `display_name` - Full name shown to users
- `description` - Brief description
- `tuition_coverage_percentage` - 0-100%
- `service_fee_usd` - Fee in USD
- `service_fee_cny` - Fee in CNY
- `includes_accommodation` - Boolean
- `includes_stipend` - Boolean
- `stipend_amount_monthly` - Decimal
- `benefits` - JSONB array of strings
- `requirements` - JSONB array of strings
- `is_active` - Boolean (show/hide)
- `display_order` - Integer (sort order)

## Pre-populated Types

The database migration includes 4 default scholarship types:

1. **Type A (100%)** - $3,500 / ¥25,000
2. **Type B (75%)** - $2,800 / ¥20,000
3. **Type C (50%)** - $2,200 / ¥16,000
4. **Self-Funded (0%)** - $1,500 / ¥11,000

You can edit these or create new ones as needed.

## Tips

1. **Keep names short** - "Type A" is better than "Type A Full Scholarship"
2. **Use display names for clarity** - "Full Scholarship (Type A)" tells students exactly what it is
3. **Be specific in benefits** - List exactly what's included
4. **Update service fees regularly** - Keep pricing current
5. **Use display order** - Put most popular options first
6. **Test before activating** - Create as inactive, preview, then activate

## Support

If you need to:

- Add new fields to scholarship types
- Create custom scholarship applications
- Generate reports on scholarship usage

Contact your developer for database schema updates.

==================================================
FILE: ./docs/guides/SETUP_COMMUNICATION_SYSTEM.md
==================================================

# Setup Communication System

## 🚀 Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create Database Tables

You need to run the SQL script to create the messaging and payment tables.

**Go to Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the entire content of `DATABASE_ADD_COMMUNICATION_PAYMENT.sql`
6. Click **Run** or press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`

This will create:

- ✅ `application_messages` table
- ✅ `payment_transactions` table
- ✅ `email_notifications` table
- ✅ `notification_preferences` table
- ✅ `document_requests` table
- ✅ `acceptance_letters` table
- ✅ `interview_schedules` table
- ✅ All triggers and RLS policies

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created

Run this query to check:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN (
    'application_messages',
    'payment_transactions',
    'email_notifications',
    'notification_preferences',
    'document_requests',
    'acceptance_letters',
    'interview_schedules'
);
```

You should see all 7 tables listed.

### Step 3: Test Messaging

Once tables are created, the admin can:

1. Go to admin dashboard
2. View an application
3. Send a message
4. Student will see it in their dashboard

---

## 📧 Email Notifications

Currently, emails are **logged to database** but not actually sent.

### To Enable Real Email Sending:

#### Option 1: Using Resend (Recommended)

1. **Sign up for Resend:**
   - Go to https://resend.com
   - Create account (free tier: 100 emails/day)
   - Get API key

2. **Install Resend:**

   ```bash
   npm install resend
   ```

3. **Add to `.env.local`:**

   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

4. **Uncomment code in `/src/lib/email/service.ts`:**

   ```typescript
   // Find this section and uncomment:
   const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
   const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
     from: "StudyAtChina <noreply@studyatchina.com>",
     to: params.to,
     subject: params.subject,
     html: params.html,
     text: params.text,
   });
   ```

5. **Update status from 'sent' to 'pending':**
   ```typescript
   status: 'pending', // Will be 'sent' after Resend confirms
   ```

#### Option 2: Using SendGrid

1. Sign up at https://sendgrid.com
2. Get API key
3. Install: `npm install @sendgrid/mail`
4. Add to `.env.local`: `SENDGRID_API_KEY=xxx`
5. Update `/src/lib/email/service.ts` to use SendGrid

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "No messages showing for student"

**Check:**

1. ✅ Tables created in database
2. ✅ Message was actually created (check Supabase table)
3. ✅ Student is logged in with correct account
4. ✅ RLS policies allow student to see their messages

**Verify message exists:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM application_messages
WHERE application_id = 'your-application-id';
```

### "Email not sent"

**Current behavior:**

- Emails are logged to `email_notifications` table
- Status will be 'sent' (but not actually sent)
- To actually send, integrate Resend or SendGrid (see above)

**Check email logs:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM email_notifications
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### "Student can't see messages"

**Check RLS policy:**

```sql
-- This should return the student's messages
SELECT m.*
FROM application_messages m
JOIN applications a ON a.id = m.application_id
WHERE a.student_id = 'student-user-id';
```

## 📱 Admin Send Message Feature

Currently, the admin dashboard doesn't have a UI to send messages yet.

==================================================

# Slug-Based URLs Implementation ✅

## 🎯 Overview

Updated university URLs to use **human-readable slugs** instead of UUIDs!

## 📝 Changes Made

### Before (UUID):

```
❌ http://localhost:3000/universities/59a89e04-1821-44c4-8307-22717c4e3c3b
```

### After (Slug):

```
✅ http://localhost:3000/universities/tsinghua-university
```

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### 1. **Route Folder Renamed**

```
Before: /universities/[id]/page.tsx
After:  /universities/[slug]/page.tsx
```

### 2. **Database Query Updated**

```typescript
// Before
.eq("id", id)

// After
.eq("slug", slug)
```

### 3. **All Links Updated**

- UniversityCard component
- FeaturedUniversitiesSection component
- All university links now use slug

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Public University Page:

**File:** `/src/app/(public)/universities/[slug]/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Before
export default async function UniversityDetailPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>;
}) {
  const { id } = await params;

  const { data: university } = await supabase
    .from("universities")
    .eq("id", id)
    .single();
}

// After
export default async function UniversityDetailPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
}) {
  const { slug } = await params;

  const { data: university } = await supabase
    .from("universities")
    .eq("slug", slug)
    .single();
}
```

### University Card Component:

**File:** `/src/components/universities/UniversityCard.tsx`

```typescript
// Before
<Link href={`/universities/${university.id}`}>
    <Button>View University</Button>
</Link>

// After
<Link href={`/universities/${university.slug}`}>
    <Button>View University</Button>
</Link>
```

### Featured Universities Section:

**File:** `/src/components/home/FeaturedUniversitiesSection.tsx`

```typescript
// Before
<Link href={`/universities/${uni.id}`}>
    <Button>View</Button>
</Link>

// After
<Link href={`/universities/${uni.slug}`}>
    <Button>View</Button>
</Link>
```

---

## 🌐 URL Examples

### Real-World Examples:

| University              | Old URL                  | New URL                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Tsinghua University** | `/universities/uuid-123` | `/universities/tsinghua-university`           |
| **Peking University**   | `/universities/uuid-456` | `/universities/peking-university`             |
| **Fudan University**    | `/universities/uuid-789` | `/universities/fudan-university`              |
| **Shanghai Jiao Tong**  | `/universities/uuid-abc` | `/universities/shanghai-jiao-tong-university` |

---

## ✅ Benefits

### 1. **SEO Friendly**

```
✅ tsinghua-university (descriptive)
❌ 59a89e04-1821-44c4-8307-22717c4e3c3b (meaningless)
```

### 2. **User Friendly**

- Easy to read
- Easy to remember
- Easy to share
- Professional appearance

### 3. **Better Analytics**

- Track by university name
- Clearer URL patterns
- Better reporting

### 4. **Social Sharing**

```
When shared on social media:
✅ "Check out Tsinghua University"
   /universities/tsinghua-university

❌ "Check out this university"
   /universities/59a89e04-1821-44c4-8307-22717c4e3c3b
```

---

## 📊 Slug Format

### Slug Generation Rules:

```typescript
// Example slug generation
const generateSlug = (name: string) => {
    return name
        .toLowerCase()                    // tsinghua university
        .replace(/\s+/g, '-')            // tsinghua-university
        .replace(/[^\w\-]+/g, '')        // remove special chars
        .replace(/\-\-+/g, '-')          // single dashes
        .replace(/^-+/, '')              // trim start
        .replace(/-+$/, '');             // trim end
};

// Examples:
"Tsinghua University" → "tsinghua-university"
"Shanghai Jiao Tong University" → "shanghai-jiao-tong-university"
"Beijing Normal University" → "beijing-normal-university"
```

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### URL Flow:

```
1. User clicks link:
   /universities/tsinghua-university

2. Next.js routes to:
   /app/(public)/universities/[slug]/page.tsx

3. Page receives params:
   { slug: "tsinghua-university" }

4. Database query:
   SELECT * FROM universities WHERE slug = 'tsinghua-university'

5. Page renders with university data
```

---

## 🛠️ Admin Panel

### Admin URLs (Still use ID):

```
Admin Edit: /admin/universities/[id]
Reason: Internal use, ID is more reliable
```

### Public URLs (Use Slug):

```
Public View: /universities/[slug]
Reason: User-facing, SEO-friendly
```

---

## 📝 Database Requirements

### Universities Table:

```sql
-- Slug column should exist
ALTER TABLE universities
ADD COLUMN slug VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE;

-- Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_universities_slug ON universities(slug);

-- Ensure slugs are unique
ALTER TABLE universities
ADD CONSTRAINT universities_slug_unique UNIQUE (slug);
```

### Example Data:

```sql
INSERT INTO universities (name, slug, city) VALUES
('Tsinghua University', 'tsinghua-university', 'Beijing'),
('Peking University', 'peking-university', 'Beijing'),
('Fudan University', 'fudan-university', 'Shanghai');
```

---

## 🔄 Migration Steps

### If you have existing universities without slugs:

```sql
-- Generate slugs from existing names
UPDATE universities
SET slug = LOWER(REPLACE(REPLACE(name, ' ', '-'), '.', ''))
WHERE slug IS NULL;

-- Verify uniqueness
SELECT slug, COUNT(*)
FROM universities
GROUP BY slug
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Fix duplicates manually if any
```

---

## 🎯 URL Patterns

### All University URLs:

```
Homepage Featured:
/universities/tsinghua-university

University List:
/universities/peking-university

Search Results:
/universities/fudan-university

Program Links:
/universities/shanghai-jiao-tong-university
```

---

## ✅ Checklist

- ✅ Route folder renamed to `[slug]`
- ✅ Page component updated to use slug
- ✅ Database query changed to `eq("slug", slug)`
- ✅ UniversityCard links updated
- ✅ FeaturedUniversities links updated
- ✅ All university links use slug
- ✅ SEO-friendly URLs
- ✅ User-friendly URLs

---

## 🚀 Result

**Professional, SEO-friendly URLs** that are:

- ✅ Easy to read
- ✅ Easy to share
- ✅ Better for SEO
- ✅ More professional
- ✅ User-friendly

### Example:

```
Before: /universities/59a89e04-1821-44c4-8307-22717c4e3c3b
After:  /universities/tsinghua-university
```

│ Category: Business & Management        │
│ Duration: 4 years                      │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```

### 4. **University-Specific Details**

```

### Step 5: Save

Click "Save Changes"

### Step 6: Repeat

Add as many scholarship types as the university offers

## Where Scholarships Appear

Once you add scholarships for a university, they automatically appear on:

1. **University Detail Page** (`/universities/[slug]`)
   - Section: "Available Scholarship Options"
   - Shows after programs list

2. **All Program Pages for That University** (`/programs/[slug]`)
   - Section: "Scholarship Options for This Program"
   - Shows after admission requirements

3. **Dynamic Display**
   - Only active scholarships are shown
   - Sorted by display_order
   - Shows all benefits clearly

## Migration Instructions

### 1. Run the Database Migration

Execute the SQL file:

```sql
-- File: DATABASE_MIGRATION_UNIVERSITY_SCHOLARSHIPS.sql
```

This will:

- Drop old `scholarship_types` table
- Create new `university_scholarships` table
- Set up proper relationships and indexes

### 2. Add Scholarships via Admin

For each university:

1. Go to `/admin/universities`
2. Click "Scholarships"
3. Add each scholarship type
4. Fill in all details
5. Save

### 3. Verify Frontend

Visit:

- Any university page
- Any program page for that university
- Check that scholarships display correctly

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Be Specific in Descriptions**
   - Good: "Free tuition, free accommodation on campus and 2500RMB/month stipend"
   - Bad: "Good scholarship"

2. **Use Consistent Naming**
   - If one university uses "Type A, B, C", stick with that pattern
   - If another uses descriptive names, that's fine too

3. **Set Display Order**
   - Put most attractive scholarships first (usually highest coverage)
   - Example: Type A (100%) = 1, Type B (75%) = 2, etc.

4. **Include Duration**
   - Always specify if it's 1 year or 4 years
   - This is crucial information for students

5. **Service Fees**
   - Keep USD and CNY in sync (approximately)
   - Update regularly if exchange rates change significantly

6. **Test Before Activating**
   - Create scholarship as inactive
   - Check the preview
   - Then activate

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Scholarships not showing on university page?**

- Check if scholarships are marked as "Active"
- Verify university_id is correct
- Check browser console for errors

**Q: How to delete a scholarship?**

- Currently, set it to "Inactive" to hide it
- Or delete directly from database if needed

**Q: Can I copy scholarships from one university to another?**

- Not via UI currently
- Can duplicate in database and change university_id

**Q: What if a university has no scholarships?**

- That's fine! The section will show "No scholarships available"
- Or you can add a generic "Contact us" scholarship type

## Support

For additional features or customizations:

- Adding bulk import for scholarships
- Copying scholarships between universities
- Custom scholarship application forms
- Integration with payment systems

Contact your developer for database schema updates.

## Recent Architectural Additions

### 1. Database Population Script (`scripts/import_csvs.py`)
Developed a Python script using parallel thread mapping and `asyncio` batching to read chunks of Excel spreadsheet datasets inside `.csv` format from the local system, dynamically querying `OpenAI` to generate compelling university data (along with tags, acronyms, and HTML layout descriptions), validating via `Pydantic` models, downloading images efficiently, and uploading to `Supabase`.

Includes full duplicate skipping using deterministic hashing/UID mapping. Supports asynchronous database UPSERT operations on relationships like `universities`, `university_programs` ensuring database integrity over 14000+ items.

### 2. Program Detail Page UI Redesign (`src/app/[locale]/(public)/programs/[slug]/page.tsx`)
Significantly modernized the UI of the detailed program view (`/programs/[slug]`) bringing a more fluid, dynamic styling. Integrated glass-morphism effect using gradients (`from-primary/5 to-background`), restyled metric grid to use prominent icons with card backgrounds, elevated typography elements to standard `geist` layouts, and ensured appropriate localization with `next-intl` throughout key requirements metrics. Expanded translation strings in `/messages` arrays to cater to `score_ielts`, `gpa_requirement`, and extra admission thresholds.
